# Rescue Line

Rescue Line is an IBM Cloud Foundry app built with NodeJS, Express, Nunjucks, Cloudant NoSQL and IBM Cloud Object Storage for image storage.
The web app front-end is pure HTML, CSS & JS.

Getting started:

1.) Make sure [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) are installed

2.) Open command line, 'cd' to your home directory and then clone this app:
```
git clone https://github.com/rogisolorzano/rescue-line
```
3.) 'cd' into newly cloned app directory
```
cd rescue-line
```
4.) Contact me for 'vcap-local.json' file that has DB info, you need to put it in the rescue-line directory or the DB won't connect and the app won't start. I didn't upload it on here for security reasons.

5.) Install any dependencies required by app
```
npm install
```
6.) Run app
```
npm start
```
7.) Go to http://localhost:8080 to view
